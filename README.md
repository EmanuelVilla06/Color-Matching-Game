# Color-Matching-Game
The purpose of the game is to create pairs of colours represented by LEDs. Because the interface has six LEDs, three pairs of three distinct colours will be created. When the game begins, the program will produce a random combination of these pairs and show them for a few seconds on the LEDs connected to the Arduino for the player to memorize. The LEDs will then turn off, and it is up to the player to match them up using the buttons adjacent to each LED. The player wins the game if they match all three pairings; the victory is represented with green flashes. If the player is unsuccessful in at least one pair, the game is lost, as shown by red flashes. In both cases, if the player wins or loses, the program ends.

Here's the Arduino setup:
